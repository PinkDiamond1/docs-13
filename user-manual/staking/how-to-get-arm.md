# How to get ARM

ARM can be minted by staking VBC to ARM contract. VBC staked to ARM contact can also be included in the mortgagor balance for the purpose of calculating issuance proceeds in the original RADR network. The only thing you need to do is set your RADR address as your memo in ARM contract.

Here is a simple guide on how to stake VBC to get ARM and set memo to get included in original RADR network issuance calculation.

**Please Note: ONLY** account that has staked VBC can get VBC back by burning ARM and the limit of burning is the remaining staked amount. Do remember to backup your secret key in a secure way, or you might not be able to get your staked VBC back.

## **Stake VBC to get ARM**

Click `VBC->ARM` button on the right side to start staking VBC to get ARM.
